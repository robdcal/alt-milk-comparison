A nutritional comparison of the different alt milks on offer.

To Do

- Compare X vs Y, select each for comparison
- Remove brand names from name field and add dynamically to label
- Add page navigation (highlight active)
- Add icons (type) to each chart item
- Colour bars by brand?
- Convert ingredients object into array
- Add more alt milks
- Cater for mixed milks (i.e. Alpro coconut & almond)
- Resize images, put in S3 bucket, update URLs in data
- Improve overall styling
- Add content to sections (from Wikipedia?)
- Optimise for mobile experience
- Add ingredients section (table with ticks, tooltip to learn about ingredient)
- Compare types of milk by average figure of specific nutritional element (bar chart with nutrition selector, only one active at a time) - exclude chocolate/etc? "Which is the healthist milk?"
