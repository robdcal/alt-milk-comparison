A nutritional comparison of the different alt milks on offer.

To Do

- Improve overall styling
- Add content to sections (from Wikipedia?)
- Scrape final alt milks
- Resize & standardise images, put in S3 bucket, update URLs in data
- Update meta (title tag, etc)
- Optimise for mobile experience
- Add ingredients section (table with ticks, tooltip to learn about ingredient)
- Compare types of milk by average figure of specific nutritional element (bar chart with nutrition selector, only one active at a time) - exclude chocolate/etc? "Which is the healthist milk?"
