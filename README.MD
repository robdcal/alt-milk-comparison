A nutritional comparison of the different alt milks on offer.

To Do

- resolve scale issue with Direct Comparison chart - only compare primary nutritional values?
- set comparisonDatasetLabelLeft and comparisonDatasetLabelRight to nutritional measurements (set manually?)
- set title of Direct Comparison chart (X vs Y)
- remove direct comparison titles underneath select dropdowns (and remove associated JS)
- Add page navigation (highlight active)
- Improve overall styling
- Scrape more alt milks
- Add content to sections (from Wikipedia?)
- Resize & standardise images, put in S3 bucket, update URLs in data
- Optimise for mobile experience
- Add ingredients section (table with ticks, tooltip to learn about ingredient)
- Compare types of milk by average figure of specific nutritional element (bar chart with nutrition selector, only one active at a time) - exclude chocolate/etc? "Which is the healthist milk?"
